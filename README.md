# machine-learning-neurodegeneration
This repository contains MATLAB code for optimizing, training, and using artificial neural networks to identify potentially effective drug combinations for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. 

The code was used for the project described in:
Anastasio TJ (2021) Predicting the Potency of Anti-Alzheimerâ€™s Drug Combinations Using Machine Learning. Processes 9(2):264.
